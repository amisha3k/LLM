##LLM From Scratch ðŸš€

This project demonstrates how to build a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, implementing every key component step by step without relying on pre-built deep learning frameworks for transformers.

The goal is to understand how LLMs work under the hood â€” from tokenization, embeddings, and transformer blocks, to attention mechanisms and text generation.
